- more testing around that validation
- make TODO's belong to users

## Notes & caveats

- This app was built in an hour bare that in mind when looking at the source code, there may be mistakes.
- This api is only covering the basics of an API Next week we will look at adding Authentication to this application.
- this example was built with TDD in mind but if you dont have experience with that you can use postman to test the API endpoints.
